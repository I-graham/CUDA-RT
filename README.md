# CUDA-RT
Ray tracer created with CUDA acceleration on the GPU. While it currently only supports Spheres and has a fairly low framerate, I intend to update it to include more shapes and run faster (by eliminating any unnecessary kernel launches).
Created with CUDA and SFML.
It only runs on 64 bit architectures, on Windows, with Nvidia GPUs which support CUDA 10.0.
